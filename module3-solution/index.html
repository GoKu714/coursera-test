      <p class="detail">Chickens are Earth’s most common birds. There are about seven chickens for every person living in the world! People have raised chickens for thousands of years for their meat and eggs.Chickens are social animals that live in groups called flocks. Each flock is made up of roosters, hens, and chicks. Roosters are male chickens, while hens are female chickens. Chicks are their babies.Each chicken started its life by hatching from an egg. Chicks grow and change over time, becoming chickens and having babies of their own. The different stages of life that an animal passes through are called its life cycle. A chicken’s life cycle begins even before it hatches. Let’s learn more about the life cycle of a chicken!Chickens are Earth’s most common birds.

      <p class="detail">A comprehensive review of the impact of tropical pasture grazing, nutritional supplementation during feedlot finishing and fat metabolism-related genes on beef cattle performance and meat-eating traits is presented. Grazing beef cattle on low quality tropical forages with less than 5.6% crude protein, 10% soluble starches and 55% digestibility experience liveweight loss. However, backgrounding beef cattle on high quality leguminous forages and feedlot finishing on high-energy diets increase meat flavour, tenderness and juiciness due to improved intramuscular fat deposition and enhanced mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. This paper also reviews the roles of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, fatty acid binding protein 4 and fatty acid synthase genes and correlations with meat traits. The review argues that backgrounding of beef cattle on Desmanthus, an environmentally well-adapted and vigorous tropical legume that can persistently surviusve under harsh tropical and subtropical conditions, has the potential to improve animal performance. It also identifies existing knowledge gaps and research opportunities in nutrition-genetics interactions aimed at a greater understanding of grazing nutrition, feedlot finishing performance, and carcass traits of northern Australian tropical beef cattle to enable red meat industry players to work on marbling, juiciness, tenderness and overall meat-eating characteristics.A comprehensive review of the impact of tropical pasture grazing, nutritional supplementation during feedlot finishing and fat metabolism-related genes on beef cattle performance and meat-eating traits is presented.

      <h3 class="text-center" id="sushi">Sushi</h3>
      <p class="detail">Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi, stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated terminal-form conjugation,  sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui "to be sour";the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi" Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi, stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time.
